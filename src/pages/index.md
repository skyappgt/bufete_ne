#     Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
#     shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
#     directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
#     profits are reinvested in their communities.

#     We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
#     That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
#     journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
#     optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
